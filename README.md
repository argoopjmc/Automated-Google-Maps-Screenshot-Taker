# Automated-Google-Maps-Screenshot-Taker
Tool for generating large number of screenshots using selenium

This this can be used for generating a large quantity of screenshots (in this case Google Maps) from an xlsx using a browser automation tool called Selenium. You can search for the file using autocompletion in the terminal. Make sure that the katitudes and longitudes are stored in the second and third column of the xlsx file respectively. The generated screenshots are stored in the same directory as the python script. Ensure that all the dependencies have been installed on the system before running.
