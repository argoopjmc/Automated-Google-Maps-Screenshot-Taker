# Automated-Google-Maps-Screenshot-Taker
Tool for generating large number of screenshots using selenium

This tool can be used for generating a large quantity of screenshots (in this case Google Maps) from an xlsx file using a browser automation tool called Selenium. You can search for the file using autocompletion in the terminal and also use this feature to chose the destination folder for saving the timestamped folder containing the images. The generated screenshots are stored in the same directory as the python script in case of any errors. Ensure that all the dependencies have been installed on the system before running.
```sh
$ npm install --global check-installed-dependencies
```
